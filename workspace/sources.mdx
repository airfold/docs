Sources make it easy to bring your data into Airfold. Sources are akin to tables in a database. They store data according to a defined schema.

All the workspace data lives inside sources, which can be queried, filtered, aggregated, and joined using SQL.

Data is ingested into sources directly through Airfold's Ingest API or by a materialized pipe.

Additionally, Sources can be enhanced into AI Sources for transforming unstructured data into structured formats, unlocking powerful analytical potential.

### Sample Sources

<CodeGroup>
```yaml source.yaml
description: "Error logs from a web server"
cols:
  ts: DateTime
  file: String
  error: String
settings: |
  MergeTree()
  PARTITION BY toYear(ts)
  ORDER BY (ts, file)
```

```yaml source_ai.yaml
description: "Error logs from a web server"
message: |-
  Output a description of the following error {error}.
cols:
  ts: DateTime
  file: String
  error: String
added_cols:
  error_description: String
settings: |
  MergeTree()
  PARTITION BY toYear(ts)
  ORDER BY (ts, file)
```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Note>
The `added_cols` field specifies which columns the AI source needs to fill, and the `message` field specifies how to fill them, using the columns from the source in curly braces.
</Note>

## The `_errors` table
Every Workspace has an associated `_errors` source table, which contains all errors that occurred during ingestion, for example, if a row failed to be ingested due to schema mismatch.

This way, the whole ingestion process is not interrupted by a single error, and the error can be reviewed and fixed later.

The `_errors` is treated like any other source, and can be queried, filtered, and joined with other sources, for example, to find the most common errors by source:

```sql
SELECT source, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM _errors
GROUP BY source
ORDER BY count DESC
```

## Properties

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A brief overview of the Source's content or purpose. Optional.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="cols" type="{name: type}" required>
  Defines the schema of the Source as a list of columns where each column name is a key and its data type is the value (see [Data Types](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types)).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="settings" type="string | {key: value} | array">
  [ClickHouse table configuration](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/table) for the Source, which can include `ORDER BY`, `PARTITION BY`, Table Engine, etc. The settings can be a String, a key-value pair, or an array comprising either or both. Optional.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A message for the AI from which it would derive the columns in `added_cols`. The message should use the Source's `cols` within curly braces e.g. `{col}`. This field is mandatory if `added_cols` is present, transforming the Source into an AI Source.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="added_cols" type="{name: type}">
  Specifies additional columns to be filled by the AI, based on the `message` field's instructions. This field is mandatory if `message` is present, transforming the Source into an AI Source.
