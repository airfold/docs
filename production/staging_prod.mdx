You can create separate workspaces for staging and production, enabling safe iteration on new features and pipeline testing without risking production stability.

## Why use Staging and Production?

Using separate workspaces for staging and production is a critical best practice for managing reliable systems.

This separation allows you to isolate development and testing environments to prevent unintended disruptions to live systems.

### Staging Workspaces
- Contain **staging data** and connection settings
- Serve as **testing environments** to validate changes, perform integration testing, and simulate production behavior
- Allow teams to iterate on new features or pipeline configurations without affecting live systems

**Use cases**:
  - Testing a new pipeline or query configuration with mock or limited data before deploying it to production
  - Debugging and resolving issues that could arise in production without impacting live users

### Production Workspaces
- Use **live data** and connection settings
- Serve data to **real users**, powering your production systems
- Provide a stable and high-performance environment for your pipelines

**Use cases**:
  - Delivering production-ready API endpoints to customers or applications
  - Running queries on the full production dataset
  - Monitoring pipeline performance and ensuring real-time data accuracy for end-users

## Example Workflow

1. **Create Workspaces**:
   - Set up two workspaces through [app.us.airfold.co](https://app.us.airfold.co/)
      - One for staging, another for production
   - For example, we may set up staging and production workspaces for `sales_calls` as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/staging_prod.png" alt="data format options" width="300"/>
</p>

2. **Develop in Staging**:
   - Create a new pipeline in the staging workspace and test it with a subset of data

3. **Validate Results**:
   - Ensure that the pipeline produces the expected results
   - Test integration with external systems or mock API calls using staging credentials

4. **Promote to Production**:
   - Once validated, deploy the same pipeline to the production workspace using live data and credentials

5. **Monitor Production**:
   - Continuously monitor the production workspace for pipeline performance, data accuracy, and API reliability

You may also separate staging and production through branching, as detailed in [Version Control](/production/version_control).
