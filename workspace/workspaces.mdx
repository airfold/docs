Workspaces help you organize and collaborate on your Airfold projects.
A workspace is an area that contains a set of resources such as [sources](/workspace/sources), [pipes](/workspace/pipes), nodes, API endpoints, and [tokens](/workspace/tokens).

It's easy to invite other users to your workspace and set appropriate permissions for each user.

## Why Use Workspaces?
Workspaces allow you to separate different projects, use cases, and dev/staging/production environments for the things you work on in Airfold.

## How to Organize Workspaces?
How to organize your workspaces in Airfold is up to you. Common patterns include a separate workspace per project, or per team.

<Tip>
Workspaces are often used to give a team, or a project, its own space to work in.

## Creating Workspaces
Creating multiple workspaces in Airfold is easy. Upon creating a workspace, you can start building immediately, no need to wait for infrastructure or configure anything.

## Workspace Files
A workspace file is a YAML file that describes a resource in Airfold, and collectively, workspace files are the source code of your Airfold workspace.
And like any source code, engineers can apply the same principles they already know and love:

- **Version control** - Push workspace files to a Git repository for version control and more efficient collaboration with your team.
- **A single source of truth** - The workspace files in the main branch of your repository are the single source of truth for your workspace. Use `git pull` to sync your local workspace with the latest changes from the main branch.
- **CI / CD** - Incorporate your CI workflows, run tests, use Airfold CLI's `af push` to deploy changes to your workspace, and more.
- **Pull Requests** - Use pull requests to review changes to your workspace before merging them into the main branch *(which can trigger a CI with `af push` to deploy changes to your workspace)*.

Workspace files are not tied to a specific workspace, and can be deployed to any workspace. This allows you to easily create new workspaces from existing ones, or to apply changes to multiple workspaces at once.

## Workspace File Structure
There are two types of workspace files **pipes** and **sources**.

Here's an example of a workspace structure:
```bash
/.airfold/config.yaml
/pipes
  /trends_per_country.yaml
  /sales_metrics.yaml
/sources
  /events.yaml
  /sales.yaml
  /sales_metrics_mv.yaml
/endpoints
  /country_trends.yaml
  /sales_over_time.yaml
```

## Push Resources to a Workspace
Push resources to your workspace using the [CLI `af push`](/reference/cli) or the [`/push` API](/api-reference/workspace/push).<br />
For example, to push all the resources in the `pipes` directory:
```bash
af push pipes/*
```

<Tip>
### Pull Resources from a Workspace
To pull all resources from your workspace to your local machine as YAML files use the [CLI `af pull`](/reference/cli) or the [`/pull` API](/api-reference/workspace/pull).

However, it is recommended to use Git to version control your workspace files with your repository being the single source of truth for your workspace, then use `git pull` to sync your local workspace with the latest changes from the main branch.
