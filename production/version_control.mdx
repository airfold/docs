By using Git repositories and YAML files, you can apply familiar engineering workflows like pull requests, branching, and [CI/CD](/production/cicd) to your projects.

Airfold workspaces are fully defined in YAML files, which enables you to leverage version control and CI/CD similar to tools like **dbt**, **Terraform**, and other **infrastructure as code** systems. 

Your files represent **data pipelines as code** with Airfold.

## Why use Version Control?

**Restore Workspace History**

Each commit represents the exact state of your Airfold workspace at a given point in time.

Easily navigate to and restore any previous version of the workspace to:
- Revert breaking changes
- Recover pipeline configurations or source definitions that were accidentally modified


**Roll Back Issues**

If a recent change causes unexpected errors, simply roll back to the last known working commit.

This is helpful for avoiding downtime in production by reverting to a stable state with minimal effort.

**Enable Collaboration**

Git enables multiple team members to work on the same workspace simultaneously without conflicts:
- Avoid overwriting others’ changes (a common risk when using a shared UI), where actions like multiple users pressing `save` on a query edit can accidentally overwrite each other’s changes
- Git merge enables a structured way to combine contributions, reducing the risk of such conflicts and ensuring every update is reviewed

**Seamless Sharing**

Within your organization:
- Store your Airfold workspace files in a shared Git repository, ensuring all team members access to latest udpates
- Team members can work on individual tasks in separate branches, avoiding conflicts with ongoing production or staging workflows
- Use pull requests to propose changes and review code before merging

You can also open-source your Airfold workspaces just as you would with any Git repository, allowing the broader community to reuse and adapt your workspaces.

**Branch for Production and Staging**

Maintain separate branches for staging and production environments:
- Use staging for testing new pipelines, changes, or integrations
- Deploy only validated changes to production

## File Structure
A typical Airfold project is organized into the following directory structure:
```
/.airfold/config.yaml          # Configuration for CLI and workspace
/pipes                         # YAML files for pipeline definitions
  /trends_per_country.yaml
  /sales_metrics.yaml
/sources                       # YAML files for data sources and materialized views
  /events.yaml
  /sales.yaml
  /sales_metrics_mv.yaml
/endpoints                     # (Optional) Organized API endpoint definitions
  /country_trends.yaml
  /sales_over_time.yaml
```

**Pipes**: Define the sequence of SQL transformations in your data pipeline
- Example: /pipes/sales_metrics.yaml
- See more on [pipe.yaml](/workspace_files/pipe_yaml)

**Sources**: Define data sources
- Example: /sources/sales.yaml
- See more on [source.yaml](/workspace_files/source_yaml)

**Endpoints**: (Optional) Define API endpoints for serving pipeline results.
- Example: /endpoints/sales_over_time.yaml

## Workflow

### Initialize

From your project directory, use Git to initialize version control:

```
git init
```

### Commit & Push

Commit existing workspace files to the repository:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Airfold workspace files"
```

Push your repository:

```
git remote add origin <repository_url>
git push -u origin main
```

### Branch for Staging and Production

Create a branch for staging:

```
git branch staging
```

Use this `staging` branch to test new changes:

```
git checkout staging
```

Once changes are validated, merge into production:

```
git checkout main
git merge staging
```

## Best Practices

Use **pull requests** for any workspace updates:
- Enable code reviews before merging changes

**Separate branches** for staging and production:
- `main` for production-ready workspace configurations
- `staging` for test configurations
