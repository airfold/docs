To create a workspace, see the steps [here](/ui/workspaces).

## Workspace Files
A workspace file is a YAML file that describes a resource in Airfold, which collectively make up the source code of your Airfold workspace.

### Key Features

- **Version control** - Push workspace files to a Git repository for version control and efficient collaboration with your team.
- **Single source of truth** - The workspace files in the main branch of your repository are the single source of truth for your workspace. Use `git pull` to sync your local workspace with the latest changes from the main branch.
- **CI / CD** - Incorporate your CI workflows, run tests, use Airfold CLI's `af push` to deploy changes to your workspace, and more.
- **Pull Requests** - Use pull requests to review changes to your workspace before merging them into the main branch (which can trigger a CI with `af push` to deploy changes to your workspace).

Workspace files are not tied to a specific workspace, and can be deployed to any workspace. You can easily create new workspaces from existing ones, or to apply changes to multiple workspaces at once.

### File Structure
There are two types of workspace files [pipes](/cli/pipes) and [sources](/cli/sources).

Here's an example:
```bash
/.airfold/config.yaml
/pipes
  /trends_per_country.yaml
  /sales_metrics.yaml
/sources
  /events.yaml
  /sales.yaml
  /sales_metrics_mv.yaml
/endpoints
  /country_trends.yaml
  /sales_over_time.yaml
```

### Push Files to a Workspace
Using the CLI command [`af push`](/cli/cli_reference) or [`/push`](/api-reference/workspace/push) API.<br />

For example, you can push all files in the `pipes` directory with:
```bash
af push pipes/*
```

### Tip
Use Git to version control your workspace files with your repository being the single source of truth for your workspace.

Then use `git pull` to sync your local workspace with the latest changes from the main branch.
