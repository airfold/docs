## Accessing your Token
From your [workspace](/concepts/workspaces), you can access your tokens by clicking on the gear icon:
![token](/images/token.png)

They are required for any operation performed via the CLI or REST API, and also safeguard the endpoints you publish within Airfold.

## Token Scope
The scope of a token determines its access level and capabilities:

- **Admin:** Grants complete access to all tables and methods. Full control over the Airfold environment.
- **Call Endpoints:** Offers read-only access to endpoints. Suitable for serving endpoints to applications.
- **Ingestion:** Provides append-only access to all sources. Suitable for ingesting data into Airfold.
