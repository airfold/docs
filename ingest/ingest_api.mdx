## Ingest

You can ingest data into a source with a few lines of code.

Simply fill in the `<>` with your specific entries:

<CodeGroup>
```JavaScript JavaScript
const data = [
  {<key>:<value>}
];

fetch('https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/<source_name>', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: <token>,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

```Python Python
import requests

data = [
  {<key>:<value>}
]

requests.post(
  'https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/<source_name>',
  headers={
    'Authorization': <token>,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  json=data
)
```

```cUrl cUrl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/<source_name> \
  --header <token> \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {<key>:<value>}
]'
```
</CodeGroup>

Here are some examples in practice:
<CodeGroup>
```JavaScript JavaScript
const data = [
    {
        "ID":"ed9f19aa-8986-4d9a-8261-3d65bb331944",
        "Transcript":"Sales Rep: Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. This is Jake from QuickCart. How are you doing? Client: Hi Jake, I'm doing well, thanks! Just busy with the online shop."
    },
    {
        "ID":"bf9d1771-30b1-4817-8385-c13711342405",
        "Transcript":"ales Rep: Good morning! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Alex from QuickCart. How are you doing? Client: Hi Alex, I’m doing well, thanks. Just busy trying to figure out the best way to improve my online store."
    }
];

fetch('https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/sales_calls_csv', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: aft_3paEjG6XBXA0examplekn6auth7tokenKPHSymSP1E,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

```Python Python
import requests

data = [
    {
        "ID":"ed9f19aa-8986-4d9a-8261-3d65bb331944",
        "Transcript":"Sales Rep: Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. This is Jake from QuickCart. How are you doing? Client: Hi Jake, I'm doing well, thanks! Just busy with the online shop."
    },
    {
        "ID":"bf9d1771-30b1-4817-8385-c13711342405",
        "Transcript":"ales Rep: Good morning! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Alex from QuickCart. How are you doing? Client: Hi Alex, I’m doing well, thanks. Just busy trying to figure out the best way to improve my online store."
    }
]

requests.post(
  'https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/sales_calls_csv',
  headers={
    'Authorization': aft_3paEjG6XBXA0examplekn6auth7tokenKPHSymSP1E,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  json=data
)
```

```cUrl cUrl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/sales_calls_csv \
  --header aft_3paEjG6XBXA0examplekn6auth7tokenKPHSymSP1E \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
    {
        "ID":"ed9f19aa-8986-4d9a-8261-3d65bb331944",
        "Transcript":"Sales Rep: Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. This is Jake from QuickCart. How are you doing? Client: Hi Jake, I'm doing well, thanks! Just busy with the online shop."
    },
    {
        "ID":"bf9d1771-30b1-4817-8385-c13711342405",
        "Transcript":"ales Rep: Good morning! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Alex from QuickCart. How are you doing? Client: Hi Alex, I’m doing well, thanks. Just busy trying to figure out the best way to improve my online store."
    }
]'
```

## Get Data Schema

You may also get the data source schema with the following API call:
<CodeGroup>
```JavaScript JavaScript
const options = {method: 'GET', headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>'}};

fetch('https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/<source_name>', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

```Python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/<source_name>"

headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```cUrl cUrl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/<source_name> \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```
