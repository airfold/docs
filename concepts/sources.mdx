Akin to tables in a database, sources store data according to a defined schema.

All the workspace data lives inside sources, which can be queried, filtered, aggregated, and joined using SQL.

## UI

### Ingesting Data

Navigate to "Sources" on the left menu bar, and click on "+":

![data format options](/images/ui_integration_options.png)

Here you can either create a source by inferring a schema from [Text](/ingest/jsonpath), [File](/ingest/schema) or [URL](/ingest/schema).<br/>

Or you can use [Connectors](/concepts/connectors) to ingest data from external sources.

<Note>
    Inferred sources will be empty. <br/>
    You can put some data into them using the [Ingest API](/ingest/ingest_api)
</Note>

#### Select Type

In this example, we will upload a csv file through `File Upload`:

![catalog upload](/images/catalog_upload.png)

Then, click `Next`.

#### Confirm Schema

Name your source and confirm the schema:

![catalog schema](/images/catalog_schema.png)

Click `Create`.

### Metrics

Once your source is successfully created, you can view its ingestion metrics and sample of the data.

![metrics](/images/product_catalog.png)

You may use the table sample features:
- `Filters` allows you to filter out certain rows based on a condition
- `Sort` can be used to order your rows in ascending/descending order based on a specified column
- `Group by` is for organizing your rows by a specified column, grouping related rows together based on a shared value in that column

<br />

There are also tabs on each `Source` page:

`Schema` provides the table schema and ClickHouse settings.

`Data Graph` shows all the dependencies for the `Source`

![graph](/images/source_graph.png)

`Logs` provides error logs. All the ingestion errors can be seen there.

## CLI

### Creating a YAML file
Define the schema for your source in a YAML file:

```yaml product_catalog.yaml
name: product_catalog
description: catalog of store products
  cols:
  ProductID: String
  Name: String
  Category: String
  Description: String
  Price: Float64
settings:
  engine: MergeTree()
  order_by: "`ProductID`"
  partition_by: tuple()
```

<br />

### Properties

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
  Type of source: `Table` or `AITable`, see more on [AI table](/concepts/ai_tables) (Optional)
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  Name of source
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A brief overview of the source's content or purpose (optional)
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="cols" type="{name: type}" required>
  Defines the schema of the source as a list of columns where each column name is a key and its data type is the value (see [Data Types](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types))
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="settings" type="string | {key: value} | array">
  [ClickHouse table configuration](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/table) for the source, which can include `ORDER BY`, `PARTITION BY`, Table Engine, etc. The settings can be a String, a key-value pair, or an array comprising either or both. Optional.
</ResponseField>

### Push
Push sources to your [workspace](/concepts/workspaces) using the [CLI command](/cli/cli_reference) `af push`.

For example, to push `sales_calls.yaml`, run:
```bash
af push sales_calls.yaml
```

## Unstructured Data

So far, we've seen examples of ingesting structured data such as `product_catalog` shown above.

However, one of Airfold's key strengths is how it allows you to work with **unstructured data**.

Examples of unstructured data:
- Sales calls transcripts
- Customer Reviews
- Customer Service Tickets

The process for ingesting unstructured data remains the same as with structured data demonstrated above. However, upon ingestion, you can extract meaningful insights from your unstructured data using [AI Tables](/concepts/ai_tables).
