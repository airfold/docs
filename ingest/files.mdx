## Data Formats
We support the following formats:
- CSV
- NDJSON
- JSON

You may upload this data via raw text, file upload, or remote URL.

## UI

Navigate to "Integrations" on the left menu bar, and click on "+":
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/ui_integration_options.png" alt="data format options" width="550"/>
</p>

Upload your data via your preferred format, then press "Continue".

<br />

From here, you can verify that your data was ingested correctly and change the name if needed:
![verification](/images/ui_integration2.png)

Once you are ready to ingest the rest of your data, press "Click Integration".

<br />

Within a few seconds, you should be able to see how many rows were ingested to verify that your data was processed correctly.

## CLI

Define the schema for your source in a YAML file:

```yaml sales_calls.yaml
name: sales_calls
description: sales call transcripts
cols:
  ID: UUID
  Transcript: String
settings:
  engine: MergeTree()
  order_by: '`ID`'
  partition_by: tuple()
```

<br />
Push sources to your [workspace](/concepts/workspaces) with `af push`.

For example, to push `sales_calls.yaml`, run:
```bash
af push sales_calls.yaml
```
