Queries are essentially SQL queries that can be applied to your tables, allowing you to filter, aggregate, and manipulate data flexibly. 

They become especially powerful with AI tables, as you can leverage structured outputs derived from unstructured data, enabling deeper insights with just a few commands.

## Creating a Query
Navigate to "Queries" on the left menu column, and click on "+":
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/ui_query1.png" alt="data format options" width="550"/>
</p>
Enter a name for this query, then press "Create".

## Nodes
Here, you have a node where you can enter a single SQL `SELECT` statement to query your tables directly. 

These SQL statements can interact with your tables in the same way as standard SQL tables, with additional AI columns you can leverage for deeper insights.

For example, to get the top 2 features mentioned in successful calls:
![sql query](/images/ui_query2.png)

We can run this by clicking on "Run":
![sql query](/images/ui_query3.png)

Click on "Save" to save this node, and "Publish" to publish it as an endpoint:
<p align="center">

</p>

See more details on [endpoints](/ui/endpoints).
