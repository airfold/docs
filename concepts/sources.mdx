Akin to tables in a database, sources store data according to a defined schema.

All the workspace data lives inside sources, which can be queried, filtered, aggregated, and joined using SQL.

## UI

### Ingesting Data

Navigate to "Sources" on the left menu bar, and click on "+":

![data format options](/images/ui_integration_options.png)

Here you can either create a source by inferring a schema from [Text](/ingest/jsonpath), [File](/ingest/files) or [URL](/ingest/files) sample.<br/>
Or you can use [Connectors](/concepts/connectors) to ingest data from external sources.

<Note>
    Inferred sources will be empty. <br/>
    You can put some data into them using the [Ingest API](/ingest/ingest_api)
</Note>

### Metrics

Each `Source` displays some ingestion metrics and also has a sample of the data in the table.

You may use the table sample features:
- `Filters` allows you to filter out certain rows based on a condition
- `Sort` can be used to order your rows in ascending/descending order based on a specified column
- `Group by` is for organizing your rows by a specified column, grouping related rows together based on a shared value in that column

<br />

There are also tabs on each `Source` page:

- `Schema` provides the table schema and ClickHouse settings.

- `Data Graph` shows all the dependencies for the `Source`

- `Logs` provides error logs. All the ingestion errors can be seen there.

## CLI

### Creating a YAML file
Define the schema for your source in a YAML file:

```yaml sales_calls.yaml
name: sales_calls
description: sales call transcripts
cols:
  ID: UUID
  Transcript: String
settings:
  engine: MergeTree()
  order_by: '`ID`'
  partition_by: tuple()
```

<br />

### Properties

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
  Type of source: `Table` or `AITable`, see more on [AI table](/concepts/ai_tables) (Optional)
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  Name of source
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A brief overview of the source's content or purpose (optional)
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="cols" type="{name: type}" required>
  Defines the schema of the source as a list of columns where each column name is a key and its data type is the value (see [Data Types](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types))
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="settings" type="string | {key: value} | array">
  [ClickHouse table configuration](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/table) for the source, which can include `ORDER BY`, `PARTITION BY`, Table Engine, etc. The settings can be a String, a key-value pair, or an array comprising either or both. Optional.
</ResponseField>

### Push
Push sources to your [workspace](/concepts/workspaces) using the [CLI command](/cli/cli_reference) `af push`.

For example, to push `sales_calls.yaml`, run:
```bash
af push sales_calls.yaml
```
