# AIRFOLD PRIVACY POLICY

**Effective Date: May 6, 2025**

## INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy describes how Airfold, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Airfold", "we", "us", and "our")
processes information about you in connection with our business. It covers personal information that is provided to us
via websites that link to this Privacy Policy (the "Sites") and your registration or participation in sales and
marketing events sponsored by our partners or by us. It also covers certain information (such as account data and usage
data, as described below) that is provided to us via your use of our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering. This Privacy
Policy also describes certain rights that you have with regard to our processing of your personal information. We
provide additional information for residents of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom
and United States residents as identified below.

Our SaaS offering is used for data analytics, pipeline building, real-time processing, and AI-powered insights (the "
Airfold Platform"). We may also offer support and professional services to better enable Authorized Users (defined
below) to configure and use our software and the Airfold Platform (such services, together with the Airfold Platform,
the "Services"). We provide the Services to our customers under an agreement with them and solely for their benefit and
the benefit of their personnel and other personnel authorized by them as users of the Airfold Platform ("Authorized
Users").

This Privacy Policy does not apply to data that Authorized Users upload or otherwise ingest into the Airfold Platform or
otherwise provide to us in connection with the Services (collectively, "Customer Data"). We process such Customer Data
pursuant to instructions provided by the customer (i.e., the customer is the "controller" or "business", and we are
the "processor" or "service provider") and our processing is governed by the applicable customer agreement. To the
extent that your personal information is included as Customer Data that is provided to us by a customer, you should
refer to the applicable customer privacy statement regarding the customer's processing of your personal information and
your rights with respect to such processing.

permitted by law and where the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your
personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.

**Special categories of personal information**. We ask you not to provide any personal information that would fall
within the special categories of personal data under applicable data protection law because we do not have the ability

us with any personal information from a special category, we will process it as "personal information" in accordance

**Your rights**. Data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information. If you are located in
Europe, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:

- **Access**. Provide you with information about our processing of your personal information, including the categories
  of personal information we collect, the sources from which personal information is collected, the business purpose for
  collecting and sharing personal information, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal
  information, and give you access to your personal information.

- **Correct/Rectification**. Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.

- **Delete/Erasure**. Delete your personal information.

  information that impacts your rights.

- **Withdraw Consent**. If we collected and processed your personal information with your consent, where required by
  law, you may withdraw your consent. Refer to "Your Choices" above for how to opt out. Withdrawing your consent does
  not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of
  your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

You may submit these requests by email to [privacy@airfold.co](mailto:privacy@airfold.co) or our postal address provided
above. You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to
respond to you.

We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law
may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal
restrictions. If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal information or our response to your
requests regarding your personal information, you may contact us or submit a complaint to the data protection regulator
in your
jurisdiction. [You can find your data protection regulator here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).
You can find contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA
available [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en), in the United
Kingdom [here](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/), and in
Switzerland [here](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

**Processing of personal information in other countries**. To provide our services, we may store and process your
personal information where Airfold and its affiliates and its third-party service providers conduct business. Our
affiliates and third parties may be found
here: [https://docs.airfold.co/legal/subprocessors](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/subprocessors). These locations may be
outside of your country of residence, including in the United States, where different data protection laws apply. Any
such transfer will be performed pursuant to the applicable requirements of the law, such as standard contractual
clauses, the individual's consent, or in other circumstances permitted by applicable data protection law. We have
implemented safeguards for the protection of any personal information that is transferred and put in place appropriate
terms to protect your personal information in our agreements with our service providers.

**EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework**. Airfold has self-certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Data
Privacy Framework Principles ("Principles") of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data
Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, as further described in
the [Airfold Data Privacy Framework](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/data-privacy-framework), and Airfold complies
with all its obligations under the Principles. Note that Airfold currently relies on the framework only for transfers of
personal data from the EU/EEA/Switzerland and the UK to the United States in its role as a processor of such personal
data for our customers. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, please
visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/), where you can view Airfold's
certifications.

**Data retention**. We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we
collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or
defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Here is how you can submit requests:

- To request access to or deletion of personal information collected via our Services, please email us
  at [privacy@airfold.co](mailto:privacy@airfold.co).
- To verify your identity prior to responding to your requests, we may ask you to confirm information that we have on
  file about you or your interactions with us. Where we ask for additional personal information to verify your identity,
  we will only use it to verify your identity or your authority to make the request on behalf of another consumer.
- **Authorized agents**. You may authorize another person (an "agent") to submit a request on your behalf. We require
  that you provide the authorized agent written permission to do so and verify your own identity directly with us. In
  some cases, we may also request that the authorized agent prove their identity or demonstrates they have power of
  attorney pursuant to applicable laws.
