<Tip>
### Create [sources](/workspace/sources) automatically!
If the target source doesn't exist, it will be created automatically by inferring the schema from the ingested events.<br />
However, it's recommended to be explicit and create the source beforehand to ensure the schema is well optimized for your use case.
