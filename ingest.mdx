The Ingest API makes it easy to bring your data into Airfold - send events in real-time as they happen, without worrying about batching or scheduling, the Ingest API can handle thousands of events/sec.<br/>

Find the [Ingest API reference here](/api-reference/ingest/ingest) and try it out live!

<Tip>
### Create [sources](/workspace/sources) automatically!
If the target source doesn't exist, it will be created automatically by inferring the schema from the ingested events.<br />
However, it's recommended to be explicit and create the source beforehand to ensure the schema is well optimized for your use case.
</Tip>

## Supported Formats
The Ingest API supports the following formats:
- NDJSON
- CSV
- Parquet

For example, ingesting NDJSON is as simple as:
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.airfold.co/v1/events/{source} \
  --header 'Authorization: <authorization>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  { "id": 123, "name": "Sarah"},
  { "id": 456, "name": "Alex"}
]'
```

## Rate Limits
The Ingest API is rate limited to 1000 events/sec per source. If you need to ingest more events, please [contact us](https://www.airfold.co).
