Airfold enables data engineers to deliver real-time data products faster than anything you've seen.

This is because Airfold is a modern platform exclusively optimized for real-time,
as a result it can provide simplicity and speed unmatched to traditional batch databases and platforms.

## Core Features of Airfold
- **Ingestion** - Send thousands of events per second directly to Airfold without ever worrying about batching or scheduling.
- **Pipelines** - Build SQL and AI pipelines directly in Airfold, using a declarative syntax that makes it easy to maintain and collaborate.
<Tip>
  Airfold pipelines are like `dbt` but for real-time. Or like `Terraform` for data pipelines,
  a sort of "data pipelines as code" that similarly integrates with Git and PR-oriented development that engineers know and love.
</Tip>
- **Publish** - Publish the result of any pipeline as a low-latency, highly concurrent endpoint. With automatically generated Swagger.
Those can be easily shared with your team and look like any other REST endpoint, hiding all the complexity from your users.
- **Observability** - Monitor the health of your pipelines and endpoints in real-time with latency, error, and throughput metrics.
- **Collaboration** - Use the UI to explore all the pipelines in your team, including dependency graph, descriptions, schemas, SQL, etc.
Onboard new members quickly, share easily, collaborate seamlessly.
- **Git** - Use `git` to version Airfold files, and easily utilize the Airfold CLI in your CI to
push changes into an Airfold workspace whenever changes are merged into `main`.
This enables a PR-oriented workflow that is familiar to developers.

{/* ## What does a pipeline look like?
Data is transformed in Airfold by chaining SQL and LLM nodes, essentially forming a DAG.
As data flows from one node to the next, each node incrementally transforms the data and passes the results to the subsequent nodes.
Every node has a defined schema and appends each result to its table, which can be published as an API endpoint with a single click.
This modularity is designed to reduce complexity and facilitate collaboration - all without compromising performance. */}

{/* ## Example use-case
For example, automating the handling of support tickets in real-time is crucial for companies to meet their SLAs and make customers happy.
Developers can stream support tickets into Airfold, then define an LLM node to tag each ticket based on urgency, department, and category,
then define a SQL node to triage which tickets must be addressed first,
and finally, publish the SQL node as an API endpoint to get the results in real-time in Streamlit, BI tools, ClickUp, Jira, etc. */}

{/* ## Why are we building airfold
We understand that what customers want is to quickly build real-time applications.
However, current options take weeks to deliver, require an expensive R&D team to maintain,
not designed for real-time, and require juggling data between different services.
For comparison, batch processing has tools like DBT, but real-time has nothing.
And this problem is growing rapidly as AI and real-time are becoming increasingly necessary for companies to stay competitive.
Airfold enables data teams to build real-time AI applications in minutes, instead of weeks.

Market leaders such as Snowflake and Databricks take weeks to build real-time AI applications,
and data teams cannot do it alone, they require an R&D team to develop extra services like API serving (which Airfold does in one click),
and they’re cost-prohibitive because they’re designed to only be used when necessary for a batch query,
but since with real-time the data is constantly being processed,
an expensive Snowflake cluster must be running at all times - which it wasn't optimized for.

Airfold is designed specifically for real-time, it doesn't support batch processing,
those design decisions make Airfold significantly more performant, easier to use,
and affordable than any other option on the market for building real-time applications.
For instance, Snowflake would have to give up batch processing and be redesigned for real-time in order to be comparable to Airfold. */}

{/* We’re the right team to go after this problem - with a decade of experience in AI and databases,
we've contributed over 2000 lines of code to ClickHouse which is used by Microsoft, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify
(amusing fact: we were invited by the founders of ClickHouse to their HQ in Amsterdam). */}
