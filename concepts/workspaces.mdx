A workspace contains all the resources you need, including [sources](/concepts/sources), [AI tables](/concepts/ai_tables), and more.

Workspaces are commonly used to separate projects and teams, but how you organize them is up to you.

## Creation
Click on the top-left corner (name of your current workspace), then click on <br />
"+ New Workspace":
![creating a workspace](/images/create_workspace_zoomed.png)

From here, you can also access your [tokens](/concepts/keys) by clicking on the gear icon.

The next step is to start ingesting data, see [sources](/concepts/sources) for further information.
