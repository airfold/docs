## NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES

Airfold will notify customers of any new sub-processors or material changes to this list in accordance with the
requirements specified in the Data Processing Addendum.

To receive notifications regarding changes to this list, please contact your Airfold representative through your
dedicated Slack Connect channel.

## OBJECTION RIGHT

If Customer reasonably objects to the addition of a new sub-processor, Customer shall notify Airfold in writing within
thirty (30) days of receipt of Airfold's notice. If Customer does not object during such time period, the new
sub-processor shall be deemed accepted.

If Customer objects to a new sub-processor, and that objection is reasonable, Airfold will use commercially reasonable
efforts to make available to Customer a change in the affected services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to
Customer's configuration or use of the affected services to avoid processing of Customer Personal Data by the
objected-to new sub-processor without unreasonably burdening Customer.

If Airfold is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, Customer may terminate the
applicable services by providing written notice to Airfold. Upon such termination, Airfold will refund to Customer any
prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term for such services following the effective date of termination.
