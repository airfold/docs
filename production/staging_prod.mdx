Airfold allows you to have separate staging and production workspaces, enabling safe iteration on new features and pipeline testing without risking production stability.

## Staging vs Production

### Staging Workspaces
- Contain **staging data** and connection settings
- Serve as **testing environments** to validate changes, perform integration testing, and simulate production behavior
- Allow teams to iterate on new features or pipeline configurations without affecting live systems

**Use cases**:
  - Testing a new pipeline or query configuration with mock or limited data before deploying it to production
  - Debugging and resolving issues that could arise in production without impacting live users

### Production Workspaces
- Use **live data** and connection settings
- Serve data to **real users**, powering your production systems
- Provide a stable and high-performance environment for your pipelines

**Use cases**:
  - Delivering production-ready API endpoints to customers or applications
  - Running queries on the full production dataset
  - Monitoring pipeline performance and ensuring real-time data accuracy for end-users

Workspaces can be set up through: [app.airfold.co](https://app.airfold.co/)

## Example Workflow

1. **Develop in Staging**:
   - Create a new pipeline in the staging workspace (e.g., `success_indicators`) and test it with a subset of data

2. **Validate Results**:
   - Ensure that the pipeline produces the expected results
   - Test integration with external systems or mock API calls using staging credentials

3. **Promote to Production**:
   - Once validated, deploy the same pipeline to the production workspace using live data and credentials

4. **Monitor Production**:
   - Continuously monitor the production workspace for pipeline performance, data accuracy, and API reliability
