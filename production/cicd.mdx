Airfold workspaces are fully defined in YAML files, which enables you to leverage [version control](/production/version_control) and CI/CD similar to tools like **dbt**, **Terraform**, and other **infrastructure as code** systems. 

Your files represent **data pipelines as code** with Airfold.

## How CI/CD Works

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the process of testing, validating, and deploying changes to your projects.

In a typical CI/CD workflow:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** ensures that changes, such as updates to pipelines or configurations, are tested and validated automatically whenever new code is pushed or a pull request is opened
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates the deployment of validated changes to staging or production environments

## Why Use CI/CD?

Implementing CI/CD for Airfold workspaces is **highly recommended** for production systems as it enables you to:
- **Automate** the process of testing, validating, and deploying changes to Airfold pipelines
- **Track changes** by leveraging version control with your CI/CD pipelines
- **Maintain consistency** across various environments (e.g., staging and production)

## GitHub Actions Example
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is one way to integrate Airfold with CI/CD pipelines.

Let's go through an example of setting up a deployment workflow for [Airlang](https://github.com/airfold/airlang) using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions):

```yaml deploy.yaml
name: Airfold deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  airfold:
    name: Plan / Apply
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          submodules: recursive
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}

      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
            python-version: 3.11

      - name: Setup Airfold CLI
        uses: airfold/setup-airfold@v1
        with:
          api-token: ${{ secrets.AIRFOLD_API_KEY }}

      - name: Airfold diff
        id: diff
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        run: |
          af diff airfold
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Airfold plan
        id: plan
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        run: |
          af push airfold --dry-run
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Airfold Status
        if: steps.plan.outcome == 'failure'
        run: exit 1

      - name: Airfold push and apply
        if: (github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push') || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
        run: af push airfold
```

### `on`

`push`: Runs the workflow whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch

`pull_request`: Executes the workflow when a pull request is opened or updated for the main branch

`workflow_dispatch`: Allows the workflow to be triggered manually from the Actions tab in GitHub

### `permissions`

Grants the workflow specific permissions:
- `id-token`: Required for OIDC authentication
- `contents`: Allows the workflow to read/write repository contents
- `pull-requests`: Enables the workflow to comment on pull requests

### `jobs`

`jobs`: Defines a single job named `Plan / Apply`

`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: Specifies the environment where the job will run

**1. Checkout Repository**
```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v3
with:
  fetch-depth: 0
  submodules: recursive
  token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```
- Clones the repository, fetching all commit history and submodules
- Authenticates using a secret `DEPLOY_TOKEN`

**2. Set Up Python 3.11**
```yaml
uses: actions/setup-python@v4
with:
    python-version: 3.11
```
- Installs and configures Python 3.11 for the workflow

**3. Setup Airfold CLI**
```yaml
uses: airfold/setup-airfold@v1
with:
  api-token: ${{ secrets.AIRFOLD_API_KEY }}
```
- Installs the Airfold CLI and configures it using the API key

**4. Airfold diff**
```yaml
id: diff
if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
run: |
  af diff airfold
continue-on-error: true
```
- Runs `af diff` to compare the current and previous states of the Airfold configuration
- Executes only for pull requests
- `continue-on-error: true`: Prevents failures in this step from stopping the workflow

**5. Airfold plan**
```yaml
id: plan
if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
run: |
  af push airfold --dry-run
continue-on-error: true
```
- Performs a dry run of `af push` to simulate changes

**6. Airfold Status**
```yaml
if: steps.plan.outcome == 'failure'
run: exit 1
```
- Stops the workflow if the plan step fails, ensuring only valid changes proceed

**7. Airfold push and apply**
```yaml
if: (github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push') || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
run: af push airfold
```
Pushes changes to Airfold workspace when:
- Code is pushed to main
- The workflow is triggered manually through `workflow_dispatch`

### GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) enable you to define workflows as code using YAML configuration files in your repository.

**High-level overview of a GitHub Actions workflow**:

1. Define a Workflow

2. Specify Triggers

3. Define Jobs
