Airfold acts as your real-time analytics backend, powering your product with live data—*without* the low latency and costly query execution found in other platforms.

Unlike traditional data stacks that process analytics in daily or hourly batches, Airfold continuously ingests and transforms your data, making it instantly available through low-latency APIs. This means your application always reflects the freshest insights—down to the second.

*Under the hood*
Airfold is built on top of ClickHouse, the fastest open-source analytical database available. This lets your APIs query billions of rows with sub-second latency—no caching layers, no pre-aggregation required. Just raw performance.

## How does Airfold work?

Taking your project from raw data to published APIs is a simple, three step process:


<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Sources"
    icon="database"
    href="#"
  >
    Sync your data into Airfold by using one of the built-in connectors, or send your data directly by using the Airfold API.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Pipes"
    icon="filter"
    href="#"
  >
    Transform and aggregate your data using Pipes by writing SQL select statements. Think dbt, but in real-time.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="APIs"
    icon="link"
    href="#"
  >
    Instantly expose your pipeline results as low-latency APIs endpoints, ready to use in your front-end.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## UI or CLI? Your choice.

You can build and manage everything in Airfold using either our intuitive UI or our developer-friendly CLI. These docs will guide you through both approaches—whether you prefer point-and-click or pipelines-as-code, you'll find everything you need to ship real-time analytics with confidence.
