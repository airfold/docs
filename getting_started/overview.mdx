- **Ingestion** - Send thousands of events per second directly to Airfold without ever worrying about batching or scheduling.
- **Pipelines** - Build SQL and AI pipelines with declarative syntax that’s easy to maintain and collaborate on. Like `dbt` but for real-time, “pipelines as code” seamlesslly integrated with Git and PR workflows that engineers know and love.
- **API Conversion** - Convert any pipeline into a low-latency, highly concurrent API with Swagger docs, shareable as a standard REST endpoint.
- **Observability** - Monitor your pipelines and endpoints in real-time with latency, error, and throughput metrics.
- **Collaboration** - Use the UI to explore team pipelines, including dependency graphs, schemas, and SQL, making collaboration and onboarding easy.
- **Git Integration** - Use `git` to version Airfold files and automate workspace updates with each CI push to `main`, enabling familiar PR-based workflows.
