## Overview
In this guide, we'll develop an API to identify the top mentioned features in sales calls.

We'll process sales call transcripts to extract insights like competitors mentioned, features mentioned, and whether it was successful. Our dataset, a 70-row CSV file, captures these activities.

Out steps include:
* Creating a workspace
* Uploading a CSV file
* Creating AI columns
* Filtering, aggregating, and refining the data into a top 2 list of features
* Exposing the top features through an API

## Create a [Workspace](/concepts/workspaces)
We start by creating a new workspace.

If this your first time using Airfold, you will be directed to our welcome page where you can simply type in a name:
![Welcome](/images/welcome_page.png)

Otherwise, you can create a new workspace by clicking on the top-left corner, then 

"+ New Workspace" :
![creating a workspace](/images/create_workspace_zoomed.png)


## Uploading a CSV file
We will be using sales call transcripts for this guide, which you can **<a href="/public/sales_calls.csv" download="sales_calls.csv">download here</a>**

Click on "Integrations" on the left column, then select "File upload":
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/integrations.png" alt="integrations" width="550"/>
</p>

From here, upload the `sales_calls.csv` file we just downloaded.

Then, name it `sales_calls_csv` and click on "Create Integration".

Within a few seconds, all of the data should be ingested:
![ingested data](/images/ingested_data.png)

## Creating AI columns
Now, we can start gathering insights from our data with AI columns.

Start by creating a Table by clicking on "Tables", then selecting `sales_calls_csv`:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/create_table.png" alt="create table" width="550"/>
</p>

We can call this `sales_calls_analysis`.

From here, we can start creating AI columns:

"+ Add column" > Select template: "+ Blank column" > "Next"

Let's create a column to indicate whether our call was successful (we define a successful call as one that scheduled a follow-up call).

Fill in the boxes like so:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/add_column.png" alt="add column" width="550"/>
</p>

You can copy and paste the description here:
```
Whether this call was successful (which is defined as successfully setting up a follow up call). If the follow up scheduling is successful, the call should include an explicit date/time for the call.
```

<br />

`Column name` is the name of your column

`Column type` is the data type of your column (we use "Checkbox" in this case since success can be a true or false value)

`Description` is a detailed description of what you wish to extract

`Default value` is what the value defaults to

`Select related columns` are the columns that are relevant to extracting this data

<br />

Now, click on "Create" > hover over the column name > <Icon icon="play" iconType="solid" color="#ffffff"/>  > "All rows"

Your table should look like this:
![after success](/images/table_after_success.png)
 <br />

Repeat this process for a few more AI columns:

To see which competitors are mentioned in the call:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/competitors_column.png" alt="competitors" width="550"/>
</p>

Description:
```
Who are the competitors mentioned (if any)?
```

<br />

To see which features are mentioned in the call:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/features_mentioned.png" alt="features mentioned" width="550"/>
</p>

Description:
```
Which features are mentioned in the call
```

Select options:
```
'Customizable Templates', 'Inventory Management', 'Marketing Automation', 'Customer Support Integration', 'Social Media Integration', 'None'
```

<br />
Your table should now look like this:
![final table](/images/final_table.png)

## Query Top Features
Using our AI columns, we can perform further analysis to see which top 2 features were mentioned in successful calls.

We will be using `successful` and `features_mentioned` to do this.
<br />

Click on "Queries" and create a new query `get_top_features`:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/create_query.png" alt="query" width="550"/>
</p>

From here, let's create a new node:
![node](/images/node.png)

Copy the SQL query here:
```
WITH
	arrayJoin (features_mentioned) AS feature
SELECT
	count() AS total_successful_rows,
	topK (2) (feature) AS top_features
FROM
	sales_calls_analysis
WHERE
	successful = TRUE
```

Click on "Run", then we can get the top 2 features mentioned in successful calls:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/top_features.png" alt="features" width="550"/>
</p>

## Publish as API endpoint
To publish this as an API endpoint, simply click:

"Publish" > "View Endpoint"

![api endpoint](/images/api.png)

From here, you can use your endpoint in JavaScript, Python, or cUrl by simply copying and pasting.

You can also unpublish your endpoint anytime by clicking "Unpublish".

## Next Steps
Youâ€™ve successfully uploaded data, created AI columns, and extracted insights using Airfold in a few simple steps! This workflow enables intuitive interaction with unstructured data, transforming raw call transcripts into actionable insights.

Check out how to do this through the CLI through [Quickstart (CLI)](/getting_started/quickstart_cli).
