## OVERVIEW

These Airfold Terms of Service (the "Terms"), including the [Privacy Policy](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/privacy-policy),
any Appendices, Statements of Work, and Order Form(s), collectively constitute the "Agreement" and govern your
subscription to and use of the Airfold Data Platform services ("Airfold Platform" or the "Services") provided by
Airfold, Inc. ("
Airfold", "we", "us", or "our"). This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Airfold and you or the entity
you represent ("Customer", "you", or "your") concerning the subject matter herein.

By accessing or using the Airfold Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by
these Terms. If you do not agree with any provisions in this Agreement, you should not access or use the Services. If
you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to
bind such entity to this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any written agreement currently in effect between Airfold and you, or an entity on whose
behalf you are acting, which addresses your use of the Airfold Platform, shall govern your use of the Airfold Platform
in lieu of this Agreement.

## 1. PROVISION AND USE OF THE AIRFOLD PLATFORM

### 1.1 Provision of the Airfold Platform

During the Term, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Airfold will provide to Customer, and
Customer is hereby granted the right to access and use, the Airfold Platform.

#### 1.1.1 Suspension of Access to the Airfold Platform

Airfold may suspend Customer's access to the Airfold Platform if:
(i) amounts owed to Airfold by Customer or Reseller are more than thirty (30) days past due, provided that such amounts
are not subject to a good faith payment dispute as outlined in Section 2.5 below;
(ii) Customer's use of the Airfold Platform materially degrades the performance of the Airfold Platform for other
customers or presents a material security risk, or risks causing material harm to Airfold or its other customers;
(iii) Customer uses the Airfold Platform in violation of Section 1.2.3; or
(iv) where Airfold is required to do so by applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Airfold will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior notice (
email sufficient)
of any suspension and to work diligently with Customer to resolve the underlying issue.

### 1.2 Customer's Use of the Airfold Platform

#### 1.2.1 Authorized Users

Customer's Affiliates and contractors ("Authorized Users") are also permitted to use the Airfold Platform during the
Term, provided that such use must be solely for the benefit of Customer, and Customer shall be responsible for all acts
and omissions of Authorized Users in connection with their use of the Airfold Platform, including any use of the Airfold
Platform by Authorized Users that is contrary to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

#### 1.2.2 Account Security

Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any credentials associated with Customer's account with
Airfold ("Account")
and for all activities that occur under Customer's Account. Customer will promptly notify Airfold of any unauthorized
use of Customer's Account or any other breach of security related to the Airfold Platform of which Customer becomes
aware.

#### 1.2.3 Restrictions on Use of the Airfold Platform

Customer shall not:
(i) modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer the Airfold Platform or any component
thereof;
(ii) access or use, or allow any other party to access or use, the Airfold Platform for purposes of monitoring its
availability or functionality for the purpose of designing and/or developing, in part or in whole, any competitive
products or services;
(iii) except for Authorized Users, make access to the Airfold Platform through its Account available to any third party;
(iv) sell, resell, rent, lease, offer any time-sharing arrangement, service bureau, or any service based upon, the
Airfold Platform;
(v) use the Airfold Platform to process any protected health information (as defined by the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996) without first entering into a BAA with Airfold;
(vi) use the Airfold Platform to store or process any classified information (i.e., information given a security
classification by a government body and protected against unauthorized disclosure under applicable law) or data subject
to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or similar export control regulations;
(vii) use the Airfold Platform for High Risk Activities (as defined in Exhibit A); or
(viii) otherwise use the Airfold Platform in violation of the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/acceptable-use-policy).

## 2. SUBSCRIPTION PLANS, PAYMENT, TAXES, AND DISPUTES

### 2.1 Subscription-Based Model

All Airfold customers are required to enter into a contract for the use of the Airfold Platform. Access to and use of
the Airfold Platform is subject to the execution of an Order Form detailing the subscription terms, fees, and duration.

### 2.2 Subscription Plans and Usage-Based Components

#### 2.2.1 Subscription Plans

Customer must purchase a Subscription Plan through the execution of one or more Order Forms with Airfold or issuance by
Customer of a Qualifying PO, which will be deemed to constitute, for the purposes of this Agreement, the execution by
Customer of the Order Form referenced in the applicable Qualifying PO.

#### 2.2.2 Usage-Based Pricing Components

In addition to the base Subscription Plan fees, Airfold implements usage-based pricing for the following specific
components:

1. **AI Service Tokens**: Customer will be billed for the actual usage of AI service tokens in accordance with the rates
   specified in the applicable Order Form. AI service tokens are consumed when utilizing Airfold's artificial
   intelligence features, including but not limited to natural language processing, data analysis, content generation,
   and other machine learning capabilities. Token usage is measured and billed according to the specific AI models and
   features utilized by Customer.

2. **Cluster Scaling**: Customer will be billed for any upscaling or downscaling of cluster instances based on the rates
   and terms specified in the applicable Order Form. Cluster scaling refers to changes in computational resources
   allocated to Customer's Airfold Platform deployment, including but not limited to increases or decreases in CPU,
   memory, storage capacity, or throughput capabilities. Airfold will measure and bill for such changes according to the
   rates and metrics specified in the Order Form.

Usage-based components will be billed in accordance with the billing cycle established in the Order Form. Airfold will
provide Customer with usage reports detailing the consumption of AI service tokens and any cluster scaling activities
upon Customer's request or as specified in the Order Form.

#### 2.2.3 Minimum Commitments and Overages

Customer's Order Form may specify minimum commitments for usage-based components. If actual usage falls below the
minimum commitment level, Customer will be billed for the minimum commitment amount. If actual usage exceeds any
specified thresholds or limits indicated in the Order Form, such excess usage ("Overages") will be billed at the rates
specified in the Order Form.

#### 2.2.4 Changes to Usage-Based Pricing

Airfold reserves the right to modify the pricing for usage-based components upon at least sixty (60) days' prior written
notice to Customer; provided, however, that such modifications will not apply until the renewal of Customer's
then-current Subscription Plan unless Customer consents to such modifications.

### 2.3 Payment

Airfold will invoice Customer for the fees due under each Order Form or otherwise under this Agreement and, subject to
Section 2.5 below, Customer will pay such fees within thirty (30) days after receipt of an applicable invoice. All
invoices will be paid in U.S. dollars. Payments will be made without right of set-off or chargeback. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, any and all payments made by Customer pursuant to this Agreement or any Order Form
are non-refundable, and all commitments to make any payments hereunder or under any Order Form are non-cancellable.

### 2.4 Taxes

All fees stated on an Order Form are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, value added, and excise taxes levied upon
the delivery or use of the taxable components, if any, of any Services, Credits, or Subscription Plans purchased by
Customer under this Agreement (collectively, "Taxes"). Taxes do not include any taxes on the net income of Airfold or
any of its Affiliates. Unless Customer provides Airfold a valid state sales/use/excise tax exemption certificate or
Direct Pay Permit and provided that Airfold separately states any such taxes in the applicable invoice, Customer will
pay and be solely responsible for all Taxes. If Customer is required by any foreign governmental authority to deduct or
withhold any portion of the amount invoiced for the delivery or use of the Airfold Platform under this Agreement,
Customer shall increase the sum paid to Airfold by an amount necessary for the total payment to Airfold to equal the
amount originally invoiced.

### 2.5 Payment Disputes

Customer has thirty (30) days from receipt of an invoice from Airfold to dispute such invoice by providing written
notice to Airfold stating the good faith basis for such dispute, and Airfold agrees not to exercise its contractual
remedies in connection with Customer's failure to pay any amount that is disputed by Customer in good faith within such
thirty (30) day period. The parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any such payment dispute, provided that if
any such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airfold of a dispute notice, and
notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each party shall be free to pursue any remedies available under this Agreement,
in equity or at law.

### 2.6 Purchases Through Resellers

The parties agree that Customer may purchase Credits or Subscription Plans through Airfold-authorized resellers ("
Resellers"), the use of which are subject to this Agreement. Orders for Credits or Subscription Plans purchased through
a Reseller, including multi-year commitments, are not subject to cancellation by Customer. Where Customer purchases
Credits or Subscription Plans through a Reseller, the Reseller will enter into an Order Form with Airfold for the
purchase of Credits or Subscription Plans that references this Agreement and shows Customer as the "ship to" party and
Reseller as the "bill to" party, and Reseller and Customer will enter into a separate agreement setting forth the fees
to be paid by Customer to Reseller for such Credits or Subscription Plans, as well as any other terms or conditions that
apply between them. Airfold hereby agrees that, subject to receiving payment from the Reseller, it shall be responsible
to Customer, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for providing the Credits or Subscription Plans
under any such Order Form. Customer hereby acknowledges that Airfold will not be responsible for the obligations of any
Reseller to Customer under such separate agreement, for the acts or omissions of Reseller, or for any third-party
products or services furnished to Customer by any Reseller. For the avoidance of doubt, Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 above
will be of no effect where Customer purchases Credits or Subscription Plans through a Reseller, as payment and taxes
will be addressed in the agreement between Reseller and Customer.

## 3. SUPPORT SERVICES

Subject to the timely payment of amounts owed hereunder, Airfold will provide Customer with Support Services for its use
of the Airfold Platform in accordance with the [Support Services Policy](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/support-policy).
Airfold may modify the Support Services Policy from time to time, provided that no such modification will result in a
material diminution of the overall level of support services during an applicable Order Form Term. Support Services are
provided to Customer solely for Customer's internal use in connection with the use of the Airfold Platform under this
Agreement and may not be used to supply any consulting, support, or training services regarding the Airfold Platform to
any third party other than Authorized Users.

## 4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

### 4.1 Airfold Platform

This Agreement grants Customer a limited right to use the Airfold Platform. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
understood to transfer from Airfold to Customer any intellectual property rights, and all right, title, and interest in
and to the Airfold Platform will remain (as between the parties) solely with Airfold or its third-party suppliers. The
Airfold trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the Airfold Platform are trademarks or
registered trademarks of Airfold or Airfold's third-party suppliers. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and
logos used in connection with the Airfold Platform may be the trademarks of other third parties. Airfold grants to
Customer no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Airfold or third-party trademarks under this Agreement.

### 4.2 Usage Data

Airfold collects tracking and operational data related to Customer's use of the Airfold Platform, including query logs,
metadata (object definitions and properties), and feature usage information ("Usage Data"). For the avoidance of doubt,
Usage Data does not include any Confidential Information (including Customer Data) of Customer and will not be shared
with third parties (excluding Airfold Affiliates and contractors) in a form that identifies Customer. Airfold owns all
right, title, and interest in and to Usage Data, which it reproduces, analyzes, modifies, and adapts to provide,
maintain, protect, and improve the Airfold Platform.

### 4.3 Customer Data

As between Airfold and Customer, Customer owns all rights, title, and interest in and to the Customer Data, including
all intellectual property rights therein and thereto. By submitting Customer Data to Airfold, Customer hereby grants
Airfold a sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive right to process the Customer Data solely for the
purpose of enabling Airfold to provide Customer with the Airfold Platform and Support Services, to prevent or address
service or technical problems, or as otherwise may be required by law. If Customer wishes to delete Customer Data from
Customer's Account, Airfold will use reasonable efforts to remove it, but Customer acknowledges that backups, caching,
or references to the Customer Data may not be made immediately unavailable.

### 4.4 Feedback

Customer, Customer's Affiliates, and their respective agents, may volunteer feedback to Airfold, and/or its Affiliates,
about the Airfold Platform ("Feedback"). Airfold and its Affiliates shall be irrevocably entitled to use that Feedback
for any purpose and without any duty to account, provided that, in doing so, they may not breach their obligations of
confidentiality under Section 6 of this Agreement.

## 5. SECURITY; CUSTOMER DATA AND DATA PROCESSING

### 5.1 Airfold Security

Airfold will implement reasonable and appropriate security measures for the Airfold Platform, in accordance with the
[Airfold Security Standards](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/security-standards), that are designed to protect
Customer Data against unauthorized access, modification, destruction, or disclosure. Airfold may modify the Airfold
Security Standards from time to time but will continue to provide at least the same level of security as is described in
the Airfold Security Standards as of the Effective Date.

### 5.2 Customer Responsibility for Customer Data and Data Retrieval

Customer is fully responsible for its Customer Data, including for the content, accuracy, and completeness of the
Customer Data, and any loss, liabilities, or damages resulting therefrom. Customer is solely responsible for backing up
or otherwise making duplicates of its Customer Data. Customer is solely responsible for verifying that its use, and that
of its Authorized Users, of the Airfold Platform complies with any requirements under applicable law or regulation
governing access to or use of the Customer Data. Customer is solely responsible for deleting or retrieving Customer Data
from the Airfold Platform prior to termination or expiration of this Agreement.

### 5.3 Data Processing

The parties agree to comply with the [Data Processing Addendum](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/dpa) ("DPA").

### 5.4 Malicious Code

Airfold will make commercially reasonable efforts to use industry-standard measures designed to scan, detect, and delete
Malicious Code (as defined in Exhibit A) from the Airfold Platform.

## 6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

### 6.1 Confidential Information

Both parties acknowledge that, in the course of performing this Agreement, they may obtain information relating to
products (such as goods, services, and software) of the other party, or relating to the parties themselves, which is of
a confidential and proprietary nature ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information includes materials and all
communications concerning Airfold's or Customer's business and marketing strategies, including but not limited to
employee and customer lists, customer profiles, project plans, design documents, product strategies and pricing data,
research, advertising plans, leads and sources of supply, development activities, design and coding, interfaces with the
Airfold Platform, anything provided by either party to the other in connection with the Airfold Platform and/or Support
Services provided under this Agreement, including, without limitation, computer programs, technical drawings,
algorithms, know-how, formulas, processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable or not), schematics and other technical
plans and other information of the parties which by its nature can be reasonably expected to be proprietary and
confidential, whether it is presented in oral, printed, written, graphic or photographic or other tangible form (
including information received, stored or transmitted electronically) even though specific designation as Confidential
Information has not been made. Confidential Information also includes any notes, summaries, analyses of the foregoing
that are prepared by the receiving party. Customer Data will be deemed Confidential Information of Customer without
specific designation. The Airfold Platform and Support Services will be deemed Confidential Information of Airfold
without specific designation.

### 6.2 Non-use and Non-disclosure

The parties shall at all times, both during the Term and thereafter, keep in trust and confidence all Confidential
Information of the other party, using the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own
Confidential Information of a similar nature or value, but in no event less than commercially reasonable care, and shall
not use such Confidential Information other than as necessary to carry out its duties under this Agreement, nor shall
either party disclose any such Confidential Information to third parties other than to Affiliates or as necessary to
carry out its duties under this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent, provided that each party
shall be allowed to disclose Confidential Information of the other party to the extent that such disclosure is approved
in writing by such other party, or necessary to enforce its rights under this Agreement.

The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information which:
(i) has entered the public domain or is otherwise publicly available, except where such entry or availability is the
result of a party's breach of this Agreement;
(ii) prior to disclosure hereunder was already in the receiving party's possession without restriction as evidenced by
appropriate documentation;
(iii) subsequent to disclosure hereunder is obtained by the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a third
party who has the right to disclose such information; or
(iv) was developed by the receiving party without any use of any of the Confidential Information as evidenced by
appropriate documentation.

the terms of this Agreement to potential acquirers, referral partners involved in an applicable transaction,
accountants, attorneys, and Affiliates pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement.

### 6.5 Disclosure Required by Law

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party may disclose the other party's Confidential Information in
order to comply with applicable law and/or an order from a court or other governmental body of competent jurisdiction,
and, in connection with compliance with such an order only, if such party:
(i) unless prohibited by law, gives the other party prior written notice to such disclosure if the time between that
order and such disclosure reasonably permits or, if time does not permit, gives the other party written notice of such
disclosure promptly after complying with that order; and
(ii) fully cooperates with the other party, at the other party's cost and expense, in seeking a protective order, or
confidential treatment, or taking other measures to oppose or limit such disclosure.

Each party must not release more of the other party's Confidential Information than is, in the opinion of its counsel,
reasonably necessary to comply with an applicable order.

## 8. INDEMNIFICATION

### 8.1 Airfold Obligations

Airfold will, at its expense, defend or settle any Infringement Claim (as defined in Exhibit A) and will indemnify
Customer against and pay:
(i) any settlement of such Infringement Claim consented to by Airfold; or
(ii) any damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction to such third party as relief or remedy in such
Infringement Claim.

Airfold shall not enter into any settlement agreement with respect to an Infringement Claim if such settlement agreement
requires any admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of Customer or imposes on Customer any obligation other
than the obligation to cease using the Airfold Platform or Support Services that are subject to the Infringement Claim,
unless Customer has first consented in writing to the applicable terms of such settlement agreement that are in conflict
with the foregoing limitations.

### 8.2 Exclusions

Airfold will have no obligation to Customer to the extent any Infringement Claim or resulting award is based upon or
results from:
(i) use of the Airfold Platform other than in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; or
(ii) the combination, operation, or use of the Airfold Platform with any other applications, portions of applications,
products, or services not provided by Airfold, where there would be no Infringement Claim but for such combination.

### 8.3 Certain Remedies

If the Airfold Platform is, or in Airfold's reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Infringement Claim
and/or an injunction as the result of an Infringement Claim, Airfold may, at its expense and option:
(i) obtain the right for Customer to continue to use the Airfold Platform;
(ii) modify the Airfold Platform to make it non-infringing, but substantially functionally equivalent; or
(iii) in the event that neither (i) or (ii) are, in Airfold's reasonable judgment, commercially reasonable options,
terminate Customer's right to use the Airfold Platform, in which case Airfold will promptly refund to Customer any
pre-paid unused fees.

### 8.4 Obligations of Customer

Except with respect to a matter addressed under Section 8.1 of this Agreement, Customer will, at its expense:
(i) defend, or at its option settle, but subject to Airfold's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, a

party by a court of competent jurisdiction as the result of such claim.

The obligations of the parties in this Section 8 are conditioned upon the indemnified party ("Indemnitee"):
(i) notifying the indemnifying party ("Indemnitor") promptly in writing of any threatened or pending claim for which
indemnification is being sought ("Claim"), provided that failure to provide such notice will only relieve Indemnitor of
its obligations under this Section 8 to the extent its ability to defend or settle an applicable Claim is materially
prejudiced by such failure to provide notice;
(ii) giving Indemnitor, at Indemnitor's expense, reasonable assistance and information requested by Indemnitor in
connection with the defense and/or settlement of the Claim; and
(iii) tendering to Indemnitor sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim.

Indemnitee's counsel will have the right to participate in the defense of the Claim, at Indemnitee's own expense.
Indemnitee will not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitor, make any admission or prejudicial statement,
settle, compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened Claim.

the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") and the economic sanctions regulations and guidelines of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. Customer is now and will remain in the future compliant
with all such export control laws and regulations, and will not export, re-export, otherwise transfer any Airfold goods,
software, or technology or disclose any Airfold software or technology to any person contrary to such laws or
regulations.

### 11.6 Force Majeure

Except with respect to payment obligations, neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of, or in
default under, this Agreement, as a result of any cause or condition beyond such party's reasonable control.

### 11.7 Future Features and Functions

Customer understands and agrees that any features or functions of the Airfold Platform referenced on any Airfold
website, or in any presentations, press releases, or public statements, which are not currently available or not
currently available as a generally available release, may not be delivered on time or at all. The development, release,
and timing of any features or functionality described for the Airfold Platform remains at Airfold's sole discretion.
Accordingly, Customer agrees that it is purchasing the Airfold Platform based solely upon features and functions that
are currently available as of the Effective Date, and not in expectation of any future feature or function.

### 11.8 Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles,
and all suits hereunder will be brought solely in Federal Court for the District of Massachusetts, or if that court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any Massachusetts State Court located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. This
Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any action or proceeding in any
of the applicable courts set forth above, based upon any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, forum
non conveniens, or any similar claim or defense. A breach or threatened breach, by either party of Section 6 may cause
irreparable harm for which damages at law may not provide adequate relief, and therefore the non-breaching party shall
be entitled to seek injunctive relief without being required to post a bond.

### 11.9 Non-waiver

Any failure of either party to insist upon or enforce performance by the other party of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as a waiver or
relinquishment of such party's right to assert or rely upon such provision, right, or remedy in that or any other
instance.

### 11.10 Notices

Any notice or other communication under this Agreement shall be in writing unless required or permitted otherwise
elsewhere in this Agreement. Notices for Airfold will be sent to legal@airfold.co. Notices to Customer will be sent to

acknowledged received by return email or, if an Order Form exists, if followed within one day by a mailed copy of such
notice to the physical address specified as the bill-to on an applicable Order Form.

### 11.11 Relationship of the Parties

The relationship of the parties hereunder shall be that of independent contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed
or construed to create any employment, agency, or fiduciary relationship between the parties. Each party shall be solely
responsible for the supervision, direction, control, and payment of its personnel, including, without limitation, for
taxes, deductions and withholdings, compensation and benefits, and nothing herein will be deemed to result in either
party having an employer-employee relationship with the personnel of the other party.

### 11.12 Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full
force and effect and such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to give effect the intent of
the parties and will be reformed to the extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

### 11.13 Entire Agreement; Amendment

agreement.

By entering into this Agreement, whether prior to or following receipt of any Customer purchase order or similar
document, the parties are hereby expressly showing their intention not to be contractually bound by the contents of any
