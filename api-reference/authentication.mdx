### Token Scopes
The scope of a token determines its access level and capabilities:

- **Admin:** Grants complete access to all tables and methods. Full control over the Airfold environment
- **Append:** Provides append-only access to all sources. Suitable for ingesting data into Airfold
- **Fetch:** Offers read-only access to endpoints. Suitable for serving endpoints to applications

Use your token here:
```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": [] // put your token here
  }
]
```
