In this guide, we will use the Airfold's three core concepts **Ingest**, **Transform** and **Publish**.

We'll process web events data to extract top referrers using the sample web events csv file.

Our steps include:

- Creating a workspace
- Uploading a CSV file
- Writing queries as features
- Exposing the features through an API

## Create a [Workspace](/concepts/workspaces)

We start by creating a new workspace.

If this your first time using Airfold, you will be directed to our welcome page where you can simply type in a name:
![Welcome](/images/welcome_page.png)

Otherwise, you can create a new workspace by clicking on the top-left corner, then

"+ New Workspace" :
![creating a workspace](/images/create_workspace_zoomed.png)

## Uploading a CSV file

We will be using web events data for this guide, which you can **<a href="https://github.com/airfold/docs/public/web_events_sample.csv" download="web_events_sample.csv">download here</a>**

Click on "Sources" on the left column, then select "File upload":

![adding source](/images/sources.png)

From here, upload the `web_events_sample.csv` file we just downloaded.

Then, name it `web_events_sample_csv`, make sure to select the checkbox `ingest data` before clicking on "Create source".

![upload and ingest data](/images/create_ingest_data.png)

Within a few seconds, all of the data should be ingested:
![ingested data](/images/ingested_data.png)

## Writing queries as features

Now, we can start querying the data to filter, transform or aggregate data and do analytics, simple as that.

Start by creating a pipe by clicking on "Pipes", then typing in name `topreferrers`.

Once created, add the below query inside the node, and run to get the results.

```sql
SELECT
  referrer,
  COUNT() AS num_referrers
FROM web_events_sample_csv
GROUP BY referrer
ORDER BY num_referrers DESC
LIMIT 3
```

![top referrers](/images/top_referrers.png)

## Exposing the features through an API

Once completed you can click on publish to publish the query as an endpoint.
You can view the endpoint once it's published.

![top referrers endpoint](/images/top_referrers_endpoints.png)

From here, you can use your endpoint in JavaScript, Python, or cUrl by simply copying and pasting.

![top referrers results](/images/top_referrers_endpoint_results.png)

You can also unpublish your endpoint anytime by clicking "Unpublish".

## Next Steps

Youâ€™ve successfully uploaded data, and extracted insights using Airfold in a few simple steps! This workflow enables intuitive interaction with data, transforming raw events data into actionable insights.

Check out how to do this through the CLI through [Quickstart (CLI)](/getting_started/quickstart_cli).
