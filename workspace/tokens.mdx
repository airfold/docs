Tokens protect access to your Airfold resources.

They are required for any operation performed via the CLI or REST API, and also safeguard the endpoints you publish within Airfold.

## Token Scopes
The scope of a token determines its access level and capabilities. A scope is assigned to a token upon creation.

- **Admin Scope:** Grants complete access to all tables and methods. Full control over the Airfold environment.
- **Append Scope:** Provides append-only access to all sources. Suitable for ingesting data into Airfold.
- **Fetch Scope:** Offers read-only access to endpoints. Suitable for serving endpoints to applications.

A token is required to read endpoints from published pipes.

A token looks like this:
