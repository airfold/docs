Akin to tables in a database, sources store data according to a defined schema.

All the workspace data lives inside sources, which can be queried, filtered, aggregated, and joined using SQL.

## UI

### Ingesting Data
Navigate to "Sources" on the left menu bar, and click on "+":

![data format options](/images/ui_integration_options.png)

Upload your data via your preferred format, then press "Continue".

<br />

From here, you can verify that your data was ingested correctly and change the name if needed:
![verification](/images/ui_integration2.png)

Once you are ready to ingest the rest of your data, press "Click Integration".

### Metrics
Within a few seconds, you should be able to see how many rows were ingested to verify that your data was processed correctly.

![metrics](/images/ui_integration3.png)

From here, "Data" displays all your data. You may also get a detailed look at each item by clicking on its individual cell:
![detailed view](/images/ui_integration4.png)

You may also use the table's features:
- `Filters` allows you to filter out certain rows based on a condition
- `Sort` can be used to order your rows in ascending/descending order based on a specififed column
- `Group by` is for organizing your rows by a specified column, grouping related rows together based on a shared value in that column

<br />

"Data Graph" shows any tables or queries affiliated with this source. Upon creation, you should just see the source by itself:

</p>

<br />

"Logs" provides details on any errors that occurred during ingestion (if any).

"Ingestion Example" provides the code for ingesting data that you can simply copy and paste. Available in JS, Python, and cUrl.

<br />

## CLI

### Creating a YAML file
Define the schema for your source in a YAML file:

```yaml sales_calls.yaml
name: sales_calls
description: sales call transcripts
cols:
  ID: UUID
  Transcript: String
settings:
  engine: MergeTree()
  order_by: '`ID`'
  partition_by: tuple()
```

<br />

### Properties

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
  Type of source: `Table` or `AITable`, see more on [AI table](/concepts/ai_tables) (Optional)
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  Name of source
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A brief overview of the source's content or purpose (optional)
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="cols" type="{name: type}" required>
  Defines the schema of the source as a list of columns where each column name is a key and its data type is the value (see [Data Types](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types))
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="settings" type="string | {key: value} | array">
  [ClickHouse table configuration](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/table) for the source, which can include `ORDER BY`, `PARTITION BY`, Table Engine, etc. The settings can be a String, a key-value pair, or an array comprising either or both. Optional.
</ResponseField>

### Push
Push sources to your [workspace](/concepts/workspaces) using the [CLI command](/cli/cli_reference) `af push`.

For example, to push `sales_calls.yaml`, run:
```bash
af push sales_calls.yaml
```
