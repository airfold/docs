A workspace contains all the resources you need, including [sources](/workspace/sources), [pipes](/workspace/pipes), nodes, API endpoints, and tokens.

Workspaces are commonly used to separate projects and teams, but how you organize them is up to you.

## Creation
Click on the top-left corner (name of your current workspace), then click on <br />
"+ New Workspace":
![creating a workspace](/images/create_workspace_zoomed.png)

That's it! You can now start building, see [sources](/workspace/sources) and [pipes](/workspace/pipes) for next steps.

## Authorization
From here, you can also access your tokens by clicking on the gear icon:
![token](/images/token.png)

They are required for any operation performed via the CLI or REST API, and also safeguard the endpoints you publish within Airfold.

### Token Scopes
The scope of a token determines its access level and capabilities:

- **Admin:** Grants complete access to all tables and methods. Full control over the Airfold environment
- **Append:** Provides append-only access to all sources. Suitable for ingesting data into Airfold
- **Fetch:** Offers read-only access to endpoints. Suitable for serving endpoints to applications

A token is required to read endpoints from published pipes.


## Workspace Files
A workspace file is a YAML file that describes a resource in Airfold, which collectively make up the source code of your Airfold workspace.

### Key Features

- **Version control** - Push workspace files to a Git repository for version control and efficient collaboration with your team.
- **Single source of truth** - The workspace files in the main branch of your repository are the single source of truth for your workspace. Use `git pull` to sync your local workspace with the latest changes from the main branch.
- **CI / CD** - Incorporate your CI workflows, run tests, use Airfold CLI's `af push` to deploy changes to your workspace, and more.
- **Pull Requests** - Use pull requests to review changes to your workspace before merging them into the main branch (which can trigger a CI with `af push` to deploy changes to your workspace).

Workspace files are not tied to a specific workspace, and can be deployed to any workspace. You can easily create new workspaces from existing ones, or to apply changes to multiple workspaces at once.

### File Structure
There are two types of workspace files [pipes](/workspace/pipes) and [sources](/workspace/sources).

Here's an example:
```bash
/.airfold/config.yaml
/pipes
  /trends_per_country.yaml
  /sales_metrics.yaml
/sources
  /events.yaml
  /sales.yaml
  /sales_metrics_mv.yaml
/endpoints
  /country_trends.yaml
  /sales_over_time.yaml
```

### Push Files to a Workspace
Using the CLI command [`af push`](/reference/cli) or [`/push`](/api-reference/workspace/push) API.<br />

For example, you can push all files in the `pipes` directory with:
```bash
af push pipes/*
```

<Tip>
### Tip
Use Git to version control your workspace files with your repository being the single source of truth for your workspace.

Then use `git pull` to sync your local workspace with the latest changes from the main branch.
