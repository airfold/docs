## Overview

Connectors enable seamless integration of external data sources into Airfold. They allow you to treat external data sources as native tables within your Airfold environment.

## Key Features

- Native table-like interface for all connected data sources
- Support for multiple data source types
- Configurable refresh strategies
- Seamless integration with endpoints and queries

## Supported Data Sources

| Data Source | Status | Documentation |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Snowflake  | **Available** | [View](/connectors/snowflake) |
| Amazon S3  | **Available** | [View ](/connectors/s3) |
| PostgreSQL | Coming Soon | [View](/connectors/postgres) |
| MySQL      | Coming Soon | [View](/connectors/mysql) |
| Kafka      | Coming Soon | [View](/connectors/kafka) |

## Configuration

### Refresh strategy

Each connector requires a defined refresh strategy that determines how data synchronization is handled.

#### Available Strategies

`replace`
- Replaces entire dataset on each refresh interval
- Best for complete dataset synchronization
- Use when maintaining historical data is not required

`append`
- Adds new records to existing dataset
- Maintains historical data
- Ideal for time-series or log data
- Best when tracking data changes over time

## Error Handling

Connectors implement automatic retry logic and provide detailed error messages for common issues:
- Connection timeouts
- Authentication failures
- Schema validation errors
- Rate limiting
