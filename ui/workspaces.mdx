A workspace contains all the resources you need, including [sources](/ui/sources), [AI tables](/ui/ai_tables), [queries](/ui/queries), [endpoints](/ui/endpoints), and more.

Workspaces are commonly used to separate projects and teams, but how you organize them is up to you.

## Creation
Click on the top-left corner (name of your current workspace), then click on <br />
"+ New Workspace":
![creating a workspace](/images/create_workspace_zoomed.png)

From here, you can also access your [tokens](/concepts/keys) by clicking on the gear icon.

You can now start building, see [sources](/ui/sources) for next steps on how to ingest data.
