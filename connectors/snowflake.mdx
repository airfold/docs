Airfold makes it easy to connect with your Snowflake data. It also enables you to automate data updates using scheduled cron jobs.

Weâ€™ll walk through an example of using a Snowflake connector for your workspace.

## Creation

### Create Source
Navigate to `Sources`, and click on `+`

<p align="center">

</p>

Click on `Snowflake`

</p>

### Establish Connection

</p>

**Account**

Prefix before `*.snowflake.computing.com` (e.g., lh10221.us-central1.gcp)

You can also access this with the following commands in Snowflake:
```
SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT();
```

```
SELECT CURRENT_REGION();
```

**Username**

Username for your Snowflake Account

```
SELECT CURRENT_USER();
```

**Password**

Password for your Snowflake Account

**Database**
Name of your database that you wish to access

```
SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE();
```

**Warehouse**
Name of your warehouse, defaults to `COMPUTE_WH`

```
SELECT CURRENT_WAREHOUSE();
```

**Schema**
Name of your warehouse, defaults to `PUBLIC`

```
SELECT CURRENT_SCHEMA();
```

**Role**
Name of your role

```
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

Click on "Test Connection", and you should see this:

</p>

### Select Table

Select the table you wish to add from your database:

![snowflake](/images/snowflake4.png)

### Set Up Cron job

Set up automated data updates with a cron expression:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/snowflake5.png" alt="snowflake" width="500"/>
</p>

### Confirm Schema

Airfold infers schema from Snowflake, so all you have to do is confirm whether it is correct:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/snowflake6.png" alt="snowflake" width="500"/>
</p>

And that's it! Now you have ingested data using our Snowflake connector, which will also ensure that your data sources are automatically updated.
