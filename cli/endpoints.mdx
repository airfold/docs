To publish your pipe as an API, simply add a name to the `publish` parameter:

```yaml insights.yaml
nodes:
  - node1:
      sql: |
        WITH
          arrayJoin(features_mentioned) AS feature
        SELECT
          count() AS num_successful_calls,
          topK(2)(feature) AS top_features
        FROM
          analysis
        WHERE
          successful = true
publish: insights

```

Published pipes can parameterize their SQL using Jinja2 via the params field and can be accessed (via FROM) by other pipes.

Upon pushing, you can query results using the API:

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url https://api.airfold.co/v1/pipes/insights.json \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <use auth token here>'
```

See more on the API [here](/api-reference).
