Easily transform any pipeline into a high-performance API that supports low-latency and high concurrency, ready for integration. 

Each API is provided with Swagger documentation for standardized usage, and can be accessed as a shareable REST endpoint.

## UI

### Create an Endpoint

Upon creating a query, we can publish it as an endpoint by clicking on:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/ui_endpoint1.png" alt="ai table creation" width="150"/>
</p>

Then "View endpoint":
![full page](/images/ui_endpoint2.png)

These metrics displayed show how many requests have been made, how much data has been processed, latency, and error rate.

### Use the Endpoint

The code block allows for quick copying and pasting of the API endpoint directly into your code:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/ui_endpoint4.png" alt="ai table creation" width="550"/>
</p>

Clicking on the three dots in the top right corner provides additional options:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/ui_endpoint3.png" alt="ai table creation" width="450"/>
</p>

- **Share Swagger** takes you to the Swagger page, where you can explore and test the API
- **Add Parameter** allows you to add custom parameters to tailor your API calls
- **Duplicate** creates a copy of the current endpoint
- **Discard changes** reverts any modifications made with parameters
- **Delete** removes the entire query

## CLI

### Edit YAML file

Simply add a name to the `publish` parameter:

```yaml insights.yaml
nodes:
  - node1:
      sql: |
        WITH
          arrayJoin(features_mentioned) AS feature
        SELECT
          count() AS num_successful_calls,
          topK(2)(feature) AS top_features
        FROM
          analysis
        WHERE
          successful = true
publish: insights

```
