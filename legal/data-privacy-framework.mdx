# AIRFOLD DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK NOTICE

**Last modified on May 7, 2025**

Airfold, Inc., and its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Airfold", "we", "us" and "our") have self-certified to comply with
the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (EU-US DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy
Framework (Swiss-US DPF) (collectively "Data Privacy Framework Principles") as set forth by the US Department of
Commerce. If there is any conflict between the terms in this notice and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data
Privacy Framework Principles shall govern.

## Scope

Airfold provides data analytics, pipeline building, real-time processing, and AI-powered insights solutions including,
without limitation, the Airfold Platform software-as-a-service offering. Airfold's certifications to the Data Privacy
Framework Principles apply to the personal data that authorized users of Airfold's solutions transfer to us from the
European Economic Area ("EEA"), the United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland for the provision of our services, except where
any of our agreements with those businesses stipulate a different transfer mechanism recognized by the relevant
authority (e.g. standard contractual clauses). The personal data types that our authorized users upload and store in our
services is at their discretion (subject to any limitations in the applicable agreements) and we only process personal
data in accordance with their instructions as set forth in those contracts, including the applicable Data Processing
Addendum (DPA), a current version of our standard is available
at [https://docs.airfold.co/legal/data-processing-addendum](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/data-processing-addendum)).

Note that Airfold currently relies on the framework only for transfers of personal data from the EU/EEA/Switzerland and
the UK to the United States in its role as a processor of such personal data for our customers. Airfold does not
currently rely on the frameworks for transfers of personal data from the EU/EEA/Switzerland and the UK to the United
States in its role as a controller. Instead, we continue to rely on standard contractual clauses. See
our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/privacy-policy), which provides additional details on how we collect,
use, disclose, and safeguard personal data for which Airfold is a data controller.

## Inquiries, Complaints, Dispute Resolution and Your Rights

We encourage you to contact us at [privacy@airfold.co](mailto:privacy@airfold.co) if you have any questions about this
Data Privacy Framework Statement or wish to make a complaint concerning our obligations under the Data Privacy Framework
Principles. Airfold will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints within 45 days after receipt. Airfold commits to
refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework
Principles to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.

If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to
your satisfaction, please
visit [https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution) for more
information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. If neither Airfold nor our
dispute resolution provider resolve your complaint, you may be entitled to pursue binding arbitration. Further

## Enforcement

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction over Airfold's compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles
and Airfold is subject to the FTC's investigatory and enforcement powers with respect to such compliance.

## Subprocessors

Airfold uses third party subprocessors to help us provide our services and those subprocessors may process personal
data. Airfold remains responsible and liable under the Data Privacy Framework Principles for our third party
subprocessors, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. A current list of
our subprocessors may be found
here: [https://docs.airfold.co/legal/subprocessors](https://docs.airfold.co/legal/subprocessors).

## Disclosures

Under certain circumstances, Airfold may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public
authorities, including national security or law enforcement requirements.
